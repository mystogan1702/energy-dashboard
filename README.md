PesoWatt – Cloud Energy Monitoring System (ESP32 + Firebase + React)
Real‑time energy monitoring IoT platform with an ESP32‑based sensor node, Firebase backend, and a modern React dashboard. Designed for homes, offices, and small industrial setups to track voltage, current, power, energy consumption, and cost.

🚀 Features
Real‑time monitoring – Voltage, current, active power, energy, frequency, and power factor updated every second.

Dashboard‑first architecture – Create multiple dashboards, each with its own devices, owners, and master key. No device required to start.

Secure device claiming – ESP32 registers as unclaimed; users scan and adopt it into their dashboard via a polished wizard.

Firebase Firestore backend – Efficient, scalable, and real‑time data storage with fine‑grained security rules.

Responsive React frontend – Live dashboard, historical analytics (with CSV/Excel/PDF export), notifications, event logs, system health, and device management.

Over‑the‑air updates – Secure OTA firmware updates with signature verification (coming soon).

Wi‑Fi provisioning – Captive portal (WiFiManager) with plans for BLE/QR code onboarding.

Non‑blocking firmware – Cooperative state machine design ensures smooth LED status indicators and responsive cloud communication.

🚦 Getting Started
Firmware
Clone the repository.

Open firmware/ in PlatformIO.

Set your Wi‑Fi credentials and Firebase project details in config.h.

Build and upload to your ESP32.

Dashboard
cd dashboard && npm install

Create a .env file with your Firebase config (see .env.example).

npm run dev to start the development server.

npm run build for production.

🔐 Security
Firestore security rules enforce dashboard ownership, device claiming, and creator‑based access for ESP32 telemetry.

Master key per dashboard for sensitive operations (delete, manage owners).

ESP32 credentials stored encrypted via NVS (flash encryption recommended in production).
